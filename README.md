<h2>Testers Wanted!</h2>
I'm looking for users that can test out the program. This includes general usage, bug finding, possible calculation errors, and anything else that throws a wrench into the machine. Any feedback during development is valuable, and is greatly appreciated.

<h2>Next Update</h2>
Up next is the statements module, and first focus will be on the income statement. To properly implement it, I will first need to add the business information setup for the incorporation date. This will take some time, but with the work done on the Account Detail module, the general structure to proceed with should follow the same process once the setup page is completed.

<h2>MCP & Agent Functionality</h2>
I am looking into optional packages that can utilize AI agents and MCP servers. However, I am still debating whether to include the prepared tools in this version. This functionality goes beyond the initial scope of the project, so I am still considering whether this will be part of a premium version of BeanCounter for the future. To be clear, the RESTful API will be included and is completely optional, but the tools/resources/prompts will not.

<h2>Notice</h2>
While this software is still being developed, it is likely for bugs or unintended errors to occur. Please use this software at your own risk and liability in the event of such a problem occurring.
