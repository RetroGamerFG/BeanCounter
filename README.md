<h2>Testers Wanted!</h2>
I'm looking for users that can test out the program. This includes general usage, bug finding, possible calculation errors, and anything else that throws a wrench into the machine. Any feedback during development is valuable, and is greatly appreciated.

<h2>Next Update</h2>
Before proceeding with the next major addition, I am going to spend time reworking existing code for better readability and consistentcy. This may involve splitting main functions into other classes or utilizing .FXML files, but core functionality will not change.
