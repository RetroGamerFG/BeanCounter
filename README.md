<h2>Testers Wanted!</h2>
I'm looking for users that can test out the program. This includes general usage, bug finding, possible calculation errors, and anything else that throws a wrench into the machine. Any feedback during development is valuable, and is greatly appreciated.

<h2>Next Update</h2>
This program is being rewritten to use Spring Boot. This is a framework I have no prior experience with, and am actively learning to rewrite the majority of this program. I believe this is for the best, as it will allow for better functionality beyond the Java ecosystem thanks to the emphasis on RESTful API.

<h2>Notice</h2>
While this software is still being developed, it is likely for bugs or unintended errors to occur. Please use this software at your own risk and liability in the event of such a problem occurring.
