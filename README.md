<h2>Testers Wanted!</h2>
I'm looking for users that can test out the program. This includes general usage, bug finding, possible calculation errors, and anything else that throws a wrench into the machine. Any feedback during development is valuable, and is greatly appreciated.

<h2>Next Update</h2>
BeanCounter is now being written in Spring Boot! This is a complete overhaul from it's legacy version, but can now offer more thanks to the use of the JPA/MVC model, and it's front-end through Thymeleaf. The core functionality of creating journal entries and creating account detail forms has been properly implemented. 

Currently a posted entry can only been seen on the account detail, but I will be creating a view separate from the regular entry view that is also accessible from the account detail.

<h2>MCP & Agent Functionality</h2>
I am looking into optional packages that can utilize AI agents and MCP servers. However, I am still debating whether to include the prepared tools in this version. This functionality goes beyond the initial scope of the project, so I am still considering whether this will be part of a premium version of BeanCounter for the future. To be clear, the RESTful API will be included and is completely optional, but the tools/resources/prompts will not.

<h2>Notice</h2>
While this software is still being developed, it is likely for bugs or unintended errors to occur. Please use this software at your own risk and liability in the event of such a problem occurring.
